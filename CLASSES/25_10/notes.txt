Linear regression

# SIMPLE LINEAR regression
    - SImple linear regression means that weÂ´re using only one dependant variable

    - Points used for estimation of linear model

    equation for the estimation line:
        y = t0 + t1*x + n

    MSE (means square error)
        MSE=1/n*( sum(y-y1)**2~)
        where:
        y = data point or real value
        y1 = estimated point for each n value

        Estimation line is obtained through MINIMAL MSE (IMPORTANT!!!)

    
    # Estimating t0 and t1

        t1 is the average value, inclination of the line, slope, gradient
        t0 is the value of y when t1 is zero
        n is noise, which is normal distribution (gauss distribution)


    pros of linear regression  
        1- very fast
        2- no tuning needed
        3- Very interpretable
