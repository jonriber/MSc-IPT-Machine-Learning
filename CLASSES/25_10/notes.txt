Linear regression

# SIMPLE LINEAR regression
    - SImple linear regression means that weÂ´re using only one dependant variable

    - Points used for estimation of linear model

    equation for the estimation line:
        y = t0 + t1*x + n

    MSE (means square error)
        MSE=1/n*( sum(y-y1)**2~)
        where:
        y = data point or real value
        y1 = estimated point for each n value

        Estimation line is obtained through MINIMAL MSE (IMPORTANT!!!)

    
    # Estimating t0 and t1 (FITTING!!!)

        t1 is the average value, inclination of the line, slope, gradient
        t0 is the value of y when t1 is zero
        n is noise, which is normal distribution (gauss distribution)


    # pros of linear regression  
        1- very fast
        2- no tuning needed
        3- Very interpretable


    It is very normal to have an error (small or big) using simple linear regression

    # EVALUATION OF MY MODEL
        out-of-sample = different training and testing data

        . train and test
            use all data for training 
            predicted values versus actual values
            compare my predicted values against ground proof
            calculate accuracy 
                average of actual - predicted
        . train and split
            use just a part of the data for training
            more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy
            mutually exclusive

        . K-fold cross validation (most used technique, specially when we have small dataset)
            first fold for testing and the rest for training
            second fold for testing  and the rest for  training
            ....
            ....
            final result is the average of the accuracy of K-fold



        QUESTION : How much can we trust this model??

    # EVALUATION METRICS
        ERROR = different between actual value and predicted value

        MAE (MEAN ABSOLUT ERROR)
        MSE
        RMSE (ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR) ---> most common, interpretable in the same units
        R**2 -> value between 0 and 1
        RSE (RELATIVE SQUARE ERROR)
