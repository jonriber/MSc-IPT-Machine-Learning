SVM CLASSIFICATION

SUPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)
    # MAPPING DATA TO A HIGH-DIMENSIONAL FEATURE space
    # FINDING A separator

    EXAMPLE: CHANGING THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE MAIN ANALISYS

DATA transformation:
    # WHEN YOUR DATA IS NOT SEPARABLE, AND IS LINEAR
    # AFTER MULTIPLYING IT TO X^2 (KERNELLING FUNCTION), YOU NOW HAVE YOUR DATA DISPLAYED IN A QUADRATIC FUNCTION

SVM WANT TO FIND THE BETTER hyperplane
    = THINK ABOUT IT AS A LINE THAT SEPARATES TWO GROUPS

pros and cons:

    advantages:
        - accurate high dimensional spaces
        memoey efficient

    cons:
        1 thousand rows, SVM is not efficient

    Good for image CLASSIFICATION
    text category assignment
    detecting spam
    sentiment ANALISYS
    gene expression classification
