# USE TESTING AND PRACTICE DATA IS THE FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE GETTING
DEEPER IN MACHINE LEARNING

    - PARAMENTERS FROM PRACTICE DATASET APPLIED INTO TESTING DATASET, TO PREDICT VALUES

# CLASSIFICATION
    - CATEGORIZE DATA IN CLASSES (SPAN VS NOT SPAN)
    - UNKNOWN ITEMS INTO A DISCRETE VALUE

    DETERMINES THE CLASS LABEL~

    MODELING - FROM TRAINING DATASET
    PREDICTION - USING MODELS FROM PRACTICE DATASET INTO TESTING DATASET

    REGRESSION PROBLEMS MIGHT BE TRANSFORMED IN CLASSIFICATION ISSUE, ACCORDING TO THE 
    INDEPENDENT VARIABLE~

    IF WE HAVE A VARIABLE THAT IS CONTINUOUS 0Â» REGRESSION

    CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLES: EMAIL FILTERING, DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION

    CLASSIFICATION TYPES:

        *LOGISTIC REGRESSION
            INDEPENDENT VARIABLE VS CHURN(DEPENDENT VARIABLE)
            PREDICT A VARIABLE THAT IS BINARY
            INDEPENDENT VARIABLE SHOULD BE CONTINUOUS

            EXAMPLES: PREDICT PRODUCT FAILURE PROBALITY

            IS SUITABLE WHEN:

                * DATA IS BINARY
                * IF YOU NEED PROBABILISTIC RESULTS
                * IF A LINEAR BOUNDARY IS NEEDED
                * IF NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF A FEATURE

            GOAL:
                * BUILD A MODEL THAT WORKS WITH EACH SAMPLE

            PROBABILITY IS DIFFERENT FROM 0 AND 1 ONLY, AND ONLY WHEN WE ARE CLOSE TO THE 
            BOUNDARY, THAT IS SIMILAR TO A LINEAR REGRESSION EQUATION.

            DECISION BOUNDARY IS USUALLY IN THE MIDDLE
        *SOFTMAX REGRESSION
            - COMPUTES A SCORE FOR EACH CLASS
            - ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY FOR K CLASSES, MORE THAN BINARY
            

    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LOGISTIC REGRESSION VERSUS LINEAR REGRESSION
